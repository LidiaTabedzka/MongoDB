# MongoDB
Task within Kodilla bootcamp. The aim was to use Mongo Data Base in my projects for the first time.

The app is using mongoose module to connect with MongoDB (placed on platform mLab).

It creates, modifies and then removes records in the database (CRUD operations).

Heroku is used for hosting the app: https://damp-stream-14020.herokuapp.com/
