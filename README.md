# MongoDB
Task within Kodilla bootcamp. The aim was to use Mongo Data Base in my projects for the first time.
There were 2 Tasks - a new branch on each was created.

Branch Master - The app is using mongoose module to connect with MongoDB (placed on platform mLab). It creates, modifies and then removes records in the database (CRUD operations). Heroku is used for hosting the app: https://damp-stream-14020.herokuapp.com/

Branch MongoDb-App - The app is using mongoose module to connect with MongoDB (placed on platform mLab). You can add a new song to the list, view all the saved songs and delete the selected ones. Heroku is used for hosting the app: https://still-citadel-52973.herokuapp.com/
