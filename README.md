# MongoDB
Task within Kodilla bootcamp. The aim was to use Mongo Data Base in my projects for the first time.

The app is using mongoose module to connect with MongoDB (placed on platform mLab).

You can add a new song to the list, view all the saved songs and delete the selected ones.

Heroku is used for hosting the app: https://still-citadel-52973.herokuapp.com/
